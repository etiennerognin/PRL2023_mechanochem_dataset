Supporting information and dataset for the paper "Theory of flow-induced covalent polymer mechanochemistry in dilute solutions"
===============================================================================================================================

Contents
--------

Main file
^^^^^^^^^

Use the Jupyter Notebook ``Supporting information.ipynb`` to run the data analysis
and recreate the figures of the paper.

Alternatively, open ``Supporting information.pdf`` to view the notebook outputs
in a PDF reader without having to install and run the scripts.

Raw data
^^^^^^^^

The folder ``bead-rod_dataset`` contains the results of bead-rod model simulations.
For each simulation there is binary Python ``.npz`` file containing the data, and
a text ``.json`` file containing metadata (such as date of the simulation, parameters...)

See ``Supporting information.ipynb`` to view how to import and use the data files.
